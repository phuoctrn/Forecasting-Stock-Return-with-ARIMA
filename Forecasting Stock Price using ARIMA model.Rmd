### Data Cleaning & Validation

Initially, all essential package for the time-series manipulation, analysis and forecast will be installed

```{r load-packages, echo=TRUE,results=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(magrittr)
library(knitr)
library(anytime)
library(pastecs)
library(tsibble)
library(DescTools)
library(forecast)
library(fabletools)
library(feasts)
library(stats)
library(tseries)
library(fable)
```

The historical data of ACB and EIB were downloaded from Investing.com then imported to R:

```{r}
ACB_raw <- read.csv("/Users/phuoctran/Desktop/Personal Projects/Forecasting Stock Returns using ARIMA/ACB Historical Data.csv")
EIB_raw <- read.csv("/Users/phuoctran/Desktop/Personal Projects/Forecasting Stock Returns using ARIMA/EIB Historical Data.csv")
```

Examine whether two datasets contain any null value:

```{r}
is.null(ACB_raw)  
is.null(EIB_raw)
```

Since the console returns "FALSE" for both datasets, there is no null value

Next, check class type of each variables:

```{r}
str(ACB_raw)
str(EIB_raw)
```

Owing to all variables are classifed as character, which are unable to be calculated and plotted, a class transformation is needed. Initially, the Date column will be transformed to class Date by using as.Date function:

```{r}
ACB_asdate <- anydate(ACB_raw$Date) %>% as.Date(format("%d/%m/%Y"))
EIB_asdate <- anydate(EIB_raw$Date) %>% as.Date(format("%d/%m/%Y"))
```

Next, the Price, Open, High, Low columns are turned into numeric class with as.Numeric function. Nevertheless, the comma in the figure needs to be removed first by using gsub() function:

```{r}
ACB_numeric <- as.data.frame(apply(ACB_raw[,c(2:5)], 2, function(ACB_raw) {as.numeric(gsub(",", "", ACB_raw))}))
EIB_numeric <- as.data.frame(apply(EIB_raw[,c(2:5)], 2, function(EIB_raw) {as.numeric(gsub(",", "", EIB_raw))}))
```

Similarly, the "Change %" column is transformed into numeric class after removing the "%", and formatting into deccimal by dividing with 100:

```{r}
ACB_change_numeric <- gsub("%","",ACB_raw$Change..) %>% as.numeric()/100
EIB_change_numeric <- gsub("%","",EIB_raw$Change..) %>% as.numeric()/100
```

After the class transformation, all the variables will be re-joint into a new dataframe:

```{r}
ACB <- data.frame("Date" = ACB_asdate,
                  "Price" = ACB_numeric$Price,
                  "Open" = ACB_numeric$Open,
                  "High" = ACB_numeric$High,
                  "Low" = ACB_numeric$Low,
                  "Change %" = ACB_change_numeric)

EIB <- data.frame("Date" = EIB_asdate,
                  "Price" = EIB_numeric$Price,
                  "Open" = EIB_numeric$Open,
                  "High" = EIB_numeric$High,
                  "Low" = EIB_numeric$Low,
                  "Change %" = EIB_change_numeric)
```

Double check the structure of the new dataframes:

```{r}
str(ACB)
str(EIB)
```

Reverse the dataframe order so that the Date can be from oldest to latest:

```{r}
ACB_sorted <-  ACB[nrow(ACB):1, ]
EIB_sorted  <- EIB[nrow(EIB):1, ]
```

Plotting the price chart of two stocks\

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 12}
#ACB Price plot
ACB_sorted %>% ggplot() + aes(x = `Date`, y =`Price`,group = 1) + 
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("ACB Weekly Price from 03/07/2011 to 31/07/2022") +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Time [1 Week]") + ylab("ACB Price (VND)")
#EIB Price plot
EIB_sorted %>% ggplot() + aes(x = `Date`, y =`Price`,group = 1) + 
  geom_line(color = "navy", size = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("EIB Weekly Price from 03/07/2011 to 31/07/2022") +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Time [1 Week]") + ylab("EIB Price (VND)")
```

It seems that ACB price data has invalid data point according to its abnormal spike in early 2015. Consequently, that invalid value needs to be located and removed.

```{r}
summary(ACB_sorted$Price[ACB_sorted$Date > "2015-01-01" & ACB_sorted$Date < "2016-01-01"]) 
#Determine the invalid value
print(ACB_sorted$Date[ACB_sorted$Price == 16800])
#Locating the invalid value, which at "2015-02-15"
```

Next, the row at 2015-02-15 will be dropped:

```{r}
ACB_sorted <- subset(ACB_sorted,Date != "2015-02-15")
#Drop the row with Date == "2015-02-15"
```

Replot the ACB price after removing row with invalid value:

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width = 12}
ACB_sorted %>% ggplot() + aes(x = `Date`, y =`Price`,group = 1) + 
  geom_line(color = "blue", size = 0.5) +
  ggtitle("ACB Weekly Price from 03/07/2011 to 31/07/2022") +
  theme_bw() + xlab("Time [1 Week]") + ylab("ACB Price (VND)")
```

Moreover, the spike in stock price owing to invalid value might also resulted in following invalid Stock Returns value, as Returns are calculated from stock prices. Consequently, it is better to validate the Return ("Change..") variable:

```{r}
summary(ACB_sorted$Change..[ACB_sorted$Date > "2015-01-01" & ACB_sorted$Date < "2016-01-01"])
print(ACB_sorted$Date[ACB_sorted$Change.. == min(ACB_sorted$Change..)])
#The invalid negative return is at week 2015-02-22
```

According to the summary result, there is an abnormal negative weekly return of -73.62%, which is clearly resulted from invalid data. Hence, the row which contains the invalid return should also be removed.

```{r}

ACB_sorted <- subset(ACB_sorted,Date != "2015-02-22")
```

### I. Introduction

The goal of this research is to examine the relationship between future and past (lagged) stock returns of Asia Commercial Bank (ACB) and Vietnam Export Import Commercial Joint Stock Bank (EIB). These banks are both created in the 1990s, currently two of the ten largest banks in Vietnam (Vietnam Plus 2022), serving commercial banking, institutional banking, and consumer banking (Vietstock n.d). Then, it provides trustworthy forecast model for substantial-monetary-benefits.

To investigate the relationship, we chose to use return data from 10-July-2011 to 31-July-2022 in Weekly intervals for the most sufficient dataset, which later will be effective for our finding. Firstly, we plot the ACF from the 2 banks' returns for comparisons and discussion based on the findings from the Descriptive Statistic. Finally, the predictive power of past return (RETLAG) on future return (RET) will be tested using the Arima regression model. Macroeconomic indicators reveal a country's overall economic strength or weakness (Alam 2014), therefore they serve as leading indications of stock returns. Tu (2012) stated in the banking sector, because stock prices rise when inflation rates do, increasing dividend payments and providing shareholders with a higher return, the inflation rate has a positive but insignificant impact on the ROE (Return-On-Equity). The money supply (M2) has an insignificant but negative influence on the stock return, as money supply growth will result in higher interest rates, which will encourage more saving and deposits (Garnia et al 2022). Additionally, the interest rate has a negative and significant effect on the stock return since as interest rates rise, people will prefer saving money than investing (Paul et al 2003). Changes in market return are statistically significant and have a positive impact on stock returns. The exchange rate and GDP also have a positive relationship with the stock return because capital inflows will flood into stocks if the national currency increases, and investors will wait for a suitable opportunity to receive higher market returns. Gold price has a significant positive relationship with the stock return, as the findings of Ismi (2018) show that when the gold price is high, investors will also buy stocks so that their portfolio varies with the purpose of decreasing risk because gold is recognized to have minimal risk (Erna et al 2022).

Besides the effect of external factors, internal factors such as company finance performance and dividend policy could reflect the stock price. Particularly, ROA (Return-on-Assets) indicates how profitable a company is in relation to all owed assets. The higher ROA ratio shows that firms are increasingly effective in using assets to gain net income after tax and this is a good signal about financial performance of firm (Subing et al 2017). This attracts more potential investors due to a higher return, leading to an increase in banking stock's price. Regards dividend policy, those companies that have a high dividend payment would be valued more highly, in comparison to the companies with a low dividend payment (Chu 2020). Specifically, an increase in dividend payment might be good news for the financial situation of firm and brighter prospects. Thus, the increase in expectation of investors boosts of stock market price.

### II. Selection of Time Interval and Time Horizon

For our time-series regression, weekly return is our time interval selection, according to following reasons. Firstly, owing to the characteristic t+3 of Vietnam Stock Market, in which the successful order execution at current (t+0) must wait for 3 days (t+3) to settle money/shares. Thus, the stock current price (t+0) is partially reflected by the market's 3-day-before (t-3) demand; therefore, due to difference between t of RET, and t-3 demand of daily stock price, the regression result might not fully reflect the stock RET-RETLAG relationship if the time interval selection is daily price/return. Secondly, monthly return might be a good time interval, as it has less noise, and less nonGaussian distributed than daily returns (Fama 1976). However, monthly intervals will result in less observations, especially when cross validation is applied, in which the regression model will be fit into a train data with less observations to forecast and test for accuracy. Thus, monthly return is not suitable for our case, leaving weekly return as our only time interval selection, which does not have much noise like daily, and has more observations for our regression. Regarding time horizon, our selection is 11 years of weekly return, a total of 572 observations, consisting of 10-year training and 1-year testing data sets. With 10-year train data, our forecast model can fully learn the stock return distribution across the whole economy cycle, which usually has 10-year periodicity (Harvey, Trimbur & Van Dijk 2007).

### III. Stock Charting and Descriptive Statistics

1.  **Stock Return Time Plot**

    ```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width= 12}
    ACB_sorted %>% ggplot() + aes(y=`Change..`, x= `Date`) +
      geom_line(color = "blue", size = 0.5) +
      ggtitle("ACB Weekly Return from 10/07/2011 to 31/07/2022") +
      theme_bw() +xlab("Time [1 Week]") + ylab("ACB Return (%)")
    ```

    ```{r echo=FALSE, fig.height=2.5, fig.width=12}
    EIB_sorted %>% ggplot() + aes(y=`Change..`, x= `Date`) +
      geom_line(color = "slateblue3", size = 0.5) +
      ggtitle("EIB Weekly Return from 10/07/2011 to 31/07/2022") +
      theme_bw() +xlab("Time [1 Week]") + ylab("EIB Return (%)")
    ```

2.  **Descriptive Statistic of Stock Weekly Returns**

-   **Descriptive Statistic Result**

```{r}
summary(ACB_sorted$Change..)
summary(EIB_sorted$Change..)
```

The descriptive statistics table are based on the weekly return of ACB and EIB stock for the period of July 2011 to July 2022. Therefore, there are 572 return observations in total of each stock as shown by the count.\
\
Both ACB and EIB stock witness a zero median return, meaning that 50 percent of weeks with weekly returns result in negative, and vice versa. The average return of ACB is given by the mean and is equal 0.36%. Combining with its standard deviation of 0.037, it indicates the data are clustered around the mean as it is close to zero. Meanwhile, the mean of EIB weekly return is slightly higher than ACB, accounting for 0.24%. Since the standard deviation of EIB is a small number (0.042), this value shows a low volatility in weekly return of EIB. Especially, EIB weekly return has a higher standard deviation, in comparison to ACB weekly return, thus, the return of EIB fluctuates more than the return of ACB in weekly. Furthermore, the histogram of both ACB and EIB represents a tight and steep distribution, which also confirms that much of the data observed is dispersed around the mean.\
\
In term of skewness, both ACB and EIB return result in positive figure, describing that the data set have a long tail to the right. Specifically, the skewness of EIB weekly return is 2 times higher than the skewness of ACB (0.80 compared to 0.44). Since the ACB skewness is less than 0.5, the data are fairly symmetrical, according to Dugar (2018). At the same time, the skewness of EIB is between 0.5 and 1, meaning that the data are moderately skewed. As a result, the outliers of EIB distribution curve are further outwards the right and closer to the mean of the left.\
Overall, the performance of ACB and EIB returns in weekly time frame are stable and less risky, making them a suitable investment for conservative investors.

### IV. ARIMA modelling

1.  **Model Selection**

This paper aims to apply the ARIMA model to examine the predictive power of lagged return (RETLAG) on stock returns (RET). Particularly, ARIMA model, which intensively developed by George Box and Gwilym Jerkins, is a forecasting method which produces predictions by studying the patterns of historical data (Arsyad 1995). The ARIMA stands for the AR, I and MA which also the (p, q, d) order of the model, respectively. The model assumes that time series is stationary (time-constant average variance), however, most of the economics' data are not stationary, but integrated (I). Thus, non-stationary time series needs to go through differencing process for d times before fitting ARIMA. Since ARIMA is a combination of both MA, and AR, the method is effective in explaining stationary random process, as MA and AR cannot merely explain the process individually. Therefore, the ARIMA formula consists of the value of the past, present, and past errors (Newbold 1983):

2.  **Preparing Data**

-   **Outlier Treatment**:

Outliers should be paid attention to as they can have a disproportionate effect on statistical results, leading to misleading interpretations. However, outliers should be winsorized in this case instead of removing them, because extreme stock return value is important for investors who are prone to speculation and also for risk management (Welch 2017).

```{r}
#Minimize the outlier effects by replacing outliers with according 5% and 95% values
ACB_RET_winsorized <- ACB_sorted$Change.. %>% Winsorize() %>% ts() %>% as_tsibble()
EIB_RET_winsorized <- EIB_sorted$Change.. %>% Winsorize() %>% ts() %>% as_tsibble()
```

-   **Transformation**:

Since the Stock Return's variation is not proportional with time, transformation is not required, as mathematical or box-cox transformation would be a weak one with negligible effect. Additionally, calendar, population and inflation adjustment are not needed, because the data does not have calendar variation and are not affected by population changes or the value of money.

-   **Decomposition**:

As the Stock Return time plots show no trend, seasonality or cyclic behavior, decomposition is also not necessary.

-   **Train/Test split**:

For the predictive accuracy measuring purpose, ACB's and EIB's time-series weekly stock returns are split into two periods: train and test data. Specifically, train data has a total of 520 observations (10 year of observations), to be studied and used to forecast the next 52 weeks (1 year ahead).

```{r}
ACB_RET_train <- ACB_RET_winsorized %>% filter(index <= 343)
ACB_RET_test <- ACB_RET_winsorized %>% filter(index > 343)

EIB_RET_train <- EIB_RET_winsorized %>% filter(index <= 344)
EIB_RET_test <- EIB_RET_winsorized %>% filter(index > 344) 
```

Here is the visualization for the Train/Test split:

```{r, fig.height = 2.5, fig.width= 12,echo=FALSE}
ggplot() + aes(x = ACB_RET_train$index, y = ACB_RET_train$value) + geom_line() + 
  geom_line(aes(x=ACB_RET_test$index, y = ACB_RET_test$value), color ="darkblue") +   ggtitle("Plot of ACB Weekly Return train & test data split") + 
  xlab("Time[1W]") + ylab("ACB Weekly Return (%)") +
  theme_bw() + geom_label(aes(x = 475, y = -0.07, label = "ACB Test"), color = "darkblue", size = 3.5) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = 200, y = -0.07, label = "ACB Train"), color = "black", size = 3.5)

ggplot() + aes(x = EIB_RET_train$index, y = EIB_RET_train$value) + 
  geom_line() + geom_line(aes(x=EIB_RET_test$index, y = EIB_RET_test$value), color ="darkslateblue") +
  ggtitle("Plot of EIB Weekly Return train & test data split") + xlab("Time[1W]") + ylab("EIB Weekly Return (%)") +
  theme_bw() + geom_label(aes(x = 475, y = -0.07, label = "EIB Test"), color = "darkslateblue", size = 3) + 
  geom_label(aes(x = 200, y = -0.07, label = "EIB Train"), color = "black", size = 3)
```

-   **Data Differencing:**

When comes to Time-series analysis and forecasting, it is crucial to check whether the data is stationary or not, as to fit the ARIMA model, the data should be stationary. Specifically, the ARIMA model will based on the statistical properties of the time series then predict that the data will be the same in the future as they have been in the past. Therefore, it would be easier for the model to make forecast on stationary time-series whose means and variance remain constant over time. In this case, both the statistical test and graphical examination will be taken by applying KPSS unitroot test and plotting ACF plots, respectively.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#Unitroot KPSS test
ACB_RET_train %>% features(value, unitroot_kpss)
EIB_RET_train %>% features(value, unitroot_kpss)
```

```{r, fig.height = 2, fig.width= 4,echo=FALSE}
#ACF plot
ggAcf(ACB_RET_train, lag.max = 100) + ggtitle("ACF Plot for ACB train set") + xlab("Lag[1W]")
ggAcf(EIB_RET_train, lag.max =100) + ggtitle("ACF Plot for EIB train set") + xlab("Lag[1W]")
```

\
With a KPSS p-value of merely less than the significant level (0.02 \< 0.05), and a significant spike at lag 60th, the ACB train is non-stationary; therefore, a first order differencing is needed (d = 1). On the other hand, EIB train is stationary with white-noise behavior of ACF plot and 0.1 KPSS p-value, meaning no differencing needed (d =0).\

```{r}
ACB_RET_train_diff <- diff(ACB_RET_train$value) %>% ts() %>% as_tsibble()
```

```{r}
#Retake the KPSS unitroot test after taking a difference:
ACB_RET_train_diff %>% features(value, unitroot_kpss)
```

\
With a KPSS's p-value of 0.1 after a first-order differencing, ACB Return time-series now is stationary and ready to be fitted to ARIMA model.

3.  **Fitting ARIMA Model**

-   **Identify potential (p, d, q) combinations**

```{r,fig.height = 2, fig.width= 4,echo=FALSE}
ggAcf(ACB_RET_train_diff$value, lag.max = 100) + ggtitle("ACF Plot of ACB Train after differencing")
ggPacf(ACB_RET_train_diff$value, lag.max =100) + ggtitle("pACF Plot of ACB Train after differencing")
```

```{r,fig.height = 2, fig.width= 4,echo=FALSE}
ggAcf(EIB_RET_train$value, lag.max = 100) + ggtitle("ACF Plot of EIB train")
ggPacf(EIB_RET_train$value, lag.max =100) + ggtitle("pACF Plot of EIB train")
```

\
By examining the ACF plots, the terms of AR and MA of ARIMA model can be determined. Regarding ACB, the ACF's significant lag 1 suggest a MA(1) components, while multiple lags of the pACF suggest AR(1), AR(2), and AR(3) components. By having a first order differencing, the I components of ACB's ARIMA is d = 1. Contrastively, in the case of EIB, both the plots show no significant autocorrelation, suggesting only a constant term for the model. Nevertheless, it is better to try out the simple combinations from 1-3 for EIB's ARIMA model.

```{r}
ACB_ARIMA <- auto.arima(ACB_RET_train$value, stationary = FALSE, 
                        ic = c("aicc", "aic", "bic"),
                        max.p = 3, max.d = 1, max.q = 3, trace = TRUE)

EIB_ARIMA <- auto.arima(EIB_RET_train$value, stationary = TRUE, 
                        ic = c("aicc", "aic", "bic"),
                        max.p = 3, max.d = 0, max.q = 3,
                                  trace = TRUE)
```

```{r, fig.width = 10, fig.height= 4}
checkresiduals(ACB_ARIMA)
checkresiduals(EIB_ARIMA)
```

```{r}
ACB_ARIMA_011 <- ACB_RET_train %>% model(ARIMA(value ~ pdq(0,1,1)))
report(ACB_ARIMA_011)
ACB_fc <- forecast(ACB_ARIMA_011, h = 229)
```

4.  **Forecast**

```{r, fig.height= 2.7, fig.width= 12}
ACB_fc %>% autoplot(ACB_RET_train) + 
  ggtitle("ARIMA(0,1,1) 52-Week Forecast of ACB Weekly Return") + xlab("Time[1W]") + ylab("Weekly Return(%)") + 
  theme_bw() + autolayer(ACB_RET_test,.vars = value, color = "violetred", alpha = 0.5)
```

```{r}
EIB_ARIMA_001 <- ACB_RET_train %>% model(ARIMA(value ~ pdq(0,0,1)))
report(EIB_ARIMA_001)
EIB_fc <- forecast(EIB_ARIMA_001, h = 229)
```

```{r, fig.height= 2.7, fig.width= 12}
EIB_fc %>% autoplot(EIB_RET_train) + 
  ggtitle("ARIMA(0,0,1) with mean's 52-Week Forecast of EIB Weekly Return") + xlab("Time[1W]") + ylab("Weekly Return(%)") + 
  theme_bw() + autolayer(EIB_RET_test,.vars = value, color = "forestgreen", alpha = 0.7)
```

\
5. **Measure the model accuracy:**

-   **Cross validation**

```{r, warning=FALSE}
accuracy(ACB_fc,ACB_RET_test)
accuracy(EIB_fc,EIB_RET_test)
```
Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) measures the spread between the forecast value and the actual (observed) values. In another terms, RMSE
informs accuracy level of the forecast model: the lower the RMSE, the better a model can “fit” the dataset (Barnston 1992). In this case, the
RMSE of ACB and EIB ARIMA models are 3.0542 and 4.1899, respectively. Additionally, in both models, the test accuracy is higher than train
accuracy, indicating potential overfitting in models (Ying 2019). Nevertheless, as different ARIMA models applied to different datasets, it is
irrelevant to compare RMSE between the two-stock return forecast, instead, RMSE should be used in comparing predictive power of different
forecast model that fitted to the same dataset.
-   **Multiple model comparison**
It is noticeable ARIMA models almost outperform other models in terms of predictive accuracy. ACB and EIB ARIMA models are still less
accurate than the TSLM method, and the Mean method, respectively (Table above). Nevertheless, ARIMA models have taken data stationarity
into account, whereas the Mean and TSLM methods do not.

### **V. Conclusion**
To examine the relationship between future and past stock returns of ACB and EIB, the dataset of those weekly returns from July 2011 to July
2022 with 572 observations of each bank was collected and examined. Graphically speaking, the two weekly return plots show no trend,
seasonality, or cyclic behavior; yet random fluctuations and outliers require winsorization, which means limiting extreme values to lessen the
impact of erroneous outliers on the statistical data. Moreover, they look like white noise series, indicating all variables have the same variance and
each value is uncorrelated with others. Statically speaking, EIB’s stock has a higher average return and larger volatility compared to ACB’s.
Besides, since the distribution of both ACB and EIB returns are tight and steep, the data observed tend to be close and clustered around the
mean. Furthermore, the skewness statistics indicate that the dataset of ACB is fairly symmetrical whereas the dataset of EIB is moderately
skewed, thus, the distribution of EIB returns skewed towards the right at the lower ends of values. The regression result shows that both ACB
and EIB have a negative RET-RETLAG relationship. Specifically, while the return of ACB and EIB at t is correlated to lagged error of earlier one
day return (t-1). Furthermore, almost all actual observation of test data is covered by 90-85% of both ARIMA results; and thereby, the predictive
power of RET-RETLAG exists in ARIMA model with more accuracy than others.

Regarding recommendations, there are two objectives: (i) For research-focused stakeholders: Regarding the predictive power, the RE-
RETLAG relationship is established, based on the lagged error of one-day-return before. However, the stock market is distributed by many social

and economic factors. Hence, for forecasting purposes, the internal and external factors (mentioned above) should be explored in-depth to build
up a more accurate model. (ii) For investing-focused stakeholders: As aforementioned, standard deviation from descriptive statistics of EIB is
higher than that of ACB, indicating the price of EIB is more fluctuated than ACB’s price. Besides, RET-RETLAG relationship of both stock return

exists in terms of lagged error of RETLAG. Non-technical stakeholders should pay attention on the forecasting result of the ARIMA model for

investing decision-making. Also, the consideration of other factors affecting the stock market is crucial for investing-decision, especially macro-
factors that strongly affect the return as outliers. Overall, the result of this paper suggests EIB is potential for traders to make profit in short-term

due to its significant volatility, compared to ACB; meanwhile, long-term investors should hold and buy more ACB shares instead of EIB because
ACB is more stable than EIB.
For limitations, according to Petrică, Stancu & Tindeche (2016), ARIMA model poorly handle fat-tails time series, and volatility clustering.
Particularly, fat tails are outliers (significant losses or gains) that are coming at a higher likelihood than Gaussian distributions, which usually
appear in stock return time series. During our ARIMA modeling, outlier effect has been minimized by winsorization; however, by replacing outliers
with 5% and 95% value, our ARIMA model was unable to produce large gains/losses to signal/warn the stakeholders (investors/risk mangers) in
the future. Regarding volatility clustering, stock market is volatile by nature as its volatility is impacted by multiple factors such as changes in
exchange and interest rates. Thus, the constant variance assumption of ARIMA has limited itself in forecasting changes in stock return volatility,
especially when the COVID-19 Quantitative Easing monetary policy of central banks has significantly increased the volatility of global stock
market. Thus, for accuracy improvement, our solution is to apply the GARCH model simultaneously with ARIMA, as the model is proved to have
better fit in modelling the return volatility (Begu, Sparatu & Martin 2012).
